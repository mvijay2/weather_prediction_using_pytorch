Weather Prediction using Machine Learning:

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for weather prediction using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is the Australian Weather dataset from Kaggle.

Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is preprocessed by cleaning and transforming the data into a suitable format for machine learning. The following steps are performed:

Reading the data from a CSV file
Converting the date column to datetime format
Extracting month and day from the date
Dropping any null values
Plotting and visualizing the data
Converting the target variable to an integer format
Splitting the data into input and output variables
Performing train-test split
Preprocessing the input data using standardization
Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning models are implemented and evaluated:

Decision Tree Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Support Vector Classifier
Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Usage
To use this code, simply clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook. The code will preprocess the data and train and evaluate the machine learning models. The results will be displayed in the notebook.

Dependencies
